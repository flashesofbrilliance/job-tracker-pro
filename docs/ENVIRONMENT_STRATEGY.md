## DEV Environment

### Purpose
**Development and Initial Testing** - First deployment target for feature branches and development work.

### Primary Activities
- **Feature Development Testing**: Initial validation of new features and changes
- **Developer Integration Testing**: Ensure new code integrates with existing system
- **Build Validation**: Verify that code compiles and basic functionality works
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quick feedback loop for developers during active development
- **Breaking Change Testing**: Safe environment for potentially disruptive changes

### Deployment Triggers
- **Feature branches**: `feat/*` → `env/dev/{branch-name}`
- **Development branches**: `dev/*` → `env/dev/{branch-name}`
- **Manual deployments**: For testing specific commits or experimental changes

### Validation Criteria
```bash
# DEV Environment Checks
- [x] Application builds without errors
- [x] Basic smoke tests pass (page loads, core UI renders)
- [x] No critical JavaScript errors in console
- [x] Asset loading (CSS, JS) functional
- [x] Core user flows accessible (add job, view jobs)
```

### Acceptable Issues in DEV
- Minor UI/UX inconsistencies
- Performance not optimized
- Non-critical feature bugs
- Incomplete features (works in progress)
- Console warnings (non-critical)

### Rollback Strategy
- **Immediate rollback** for build failures or critical errors
- **Previous feature branch** deployment restoration
- **Development can continue** on alternative branches during rollback

**Automated Validation, Bug Detection, Unit Testing, Functional Smoke Testing, Heuristics, and Root Cause Analysis** - Comprehensive testing and validation before user acceptance.

### Primary Activities

#### Automated Validation
- **Unit Test Execution**: Automated test suites for individual components
- **Integration Testing**: API and component integration validation
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact
- **Performance Testing**: Load time, memory usage, and response time validation
- **Security Scanning**: Basic security vulnerability assessment

#### Functional Testing
- **Smoke Testing**: Core user journeys and critical path validation
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Compatibility across different browsers and devices

```

### Bug Classification in QA
- **P0 (Critical)**: Application crashes, data loss, security breaches → **BLOCK PROMOTION**
- **P1 (High)**: Core features broken, significant UX issues → **FIX REQUIRED**
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature issues, cosmetic problems → **ACCEPTABLE**
- **P3 (Low)**: Enhancement requests, nice-to-have fixes → **BACKLOG**

### Rollback Strategy
- **Automated rollback** for P0 issues or test failure thresholds
- **Previous stable main branch** deployment
- **Detailed rollback report** with issue analysis and prevention plan

- Feature flags and configuration changes
- Database schema changes (if any)
- Performance impact metrics
- Security impact assessment
- Rollback procedures and validation
```

#### Environment Transition Tracking:
```bash
# When promoting between environments:
1. Source environment version and health status
2. Target environment previous version (for rollback)
3. List of changes being promoted
4. Validation criteria that must be met
5. Sign-off requirements and approvals
6. Rollback plan and procedures
7. Success criteria and validation steps
```
