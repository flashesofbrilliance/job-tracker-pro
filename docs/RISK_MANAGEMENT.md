# Risk Management & Rollback Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to managing deployment risks, detecting regressions, and handling rollback scenarios to ensure system reliability and minimize downtime.

## Risk Categories

### 1. Deployment Risks
- **Syntax/Build Errors**: Code that doesn't compile or build
- **Runtime Errors**: Application crashes or critical functionality broken
- **Performance Regression**: Significant slowdowns or resource usage spikes
- **UI/UX Regression**: Broken layouts, accessibility issues, or user workflow disruption
- **Data Loss/Corruption**: Issues affecting stored data or user state

### 2. Sync State Conflicts
- **Environment Drift**: Environments getting out of sync with expected versions
- **Concurrent Deployments**: Multiple deployments happening simultaneously
- **Manifest Corruption**: Build catalog or environment manifest becoming invalid
- **File Integrity Issues**: Deployed files not matching expected checksums

### 3. Process Risks  
- **Human Error**: Wrong branch deployed, incorrect promotion, manual mistakes
- **Workflow Failures**: GitHub Actions failing mid-deployment
- **Permission Issues**: Access problems during deployment
- **External Dependencies**: GitHub Pages, DNS, or network issues

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Automated checks before deployment
- Build validation (npm run build)
- Linting and code quality checks
- File integrity verification (SHA256 checksums)
- Basic smoke tests (page loads, core functionality)
- Environment health checks
```

### Deployment Safety Measures
- **Atomic Deployments**: All-or-nothing deployment process
- **Rollback Points**: Always maintain previous version for quick recovery
- **File Provenance**: SHA256 checksums for integrity verification
- **Deployment Locks**: Prevent concurrent deployments to same environment
- **Staged Rollouts**: Progressive deployment through environments

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Automated verification of deployment success
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time and resource usage tracking
- **Error Detection**: Monitor for JavaScript errors, 404s, or API failures
- **User Experience**: Key user flows and functionality validation

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Automated Rollback Triggers
- Critical errors detected in monitoring
- Health checks failing for >5 minutes  
- Performance degradation >50% from baseline
- User-reported critical functionality broken

### 2. Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Emergency rollback (any environment)
gh workflow run rollback.yml -f env=prod

# Rollback to specific version
gh workflow run rollback.yml -f env=stage -f target_path=env/stage/v1.2.0

# Verify rollback success
curl -f https://flashesofbrilliance.github.io/job-tracker-pro/env/prod/latest/
```

### 3. Rollback Validation
After rollback, verify:
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Core functionality works (add/edit/delete jobs)
- [ ] Data integrity maintained
- [ ] Performance within acceptable range
- [ ] No console errors or broken assets

## Conflict Resolution

### Environment Sync Conflicts
1. **Detection**: Compare environment versions against expected state
2. **Analysis**: Determine root cause (concurrent deployment, workflow failure, etc.)
3. **Resolution**: Use promotion workflow to restore known good state
4. **Verification**: Confirm all environments in expected state

### Manifest Corruption
1. **Backup Strategy**: Maintain manifest backups in git history
2. **Recovery**: Restore from previous commit or regenerate from environment scan
3. **Validation**: Verify all environment links and metadata are correct

### File Integrity Issues
1. **Detection**: SHA256 checksum mismatches during promotion
2. **Investigation**: Determine if corruption occurred during transfer or storage
3. **Resolution**: Re-deploy from source or restore from known good backup
4. **Prevention**: Add additional checksums and validation points

## Regression Detection

### Automated Testing
```javascript
// Example health check script
const healthChecks = [
  () => document.title.includes('Job Tracker'),
  () => document.querySelector('.job-board') !== null,
  () => localStorage.getItem('jobs') !== undefined,
  () => !document.querySelector('.error-message')
];
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Page load time baselines
- JavaScript execution time tracking  
- Memory usage monitoring
- API response time measurements

### User Experience Validation
- Critical user flows (add job, change status, search/filter)
- Accessibility compliance checks
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Browser compatibility testing

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Complete application failure, data loss, security breach
- **P1 (High)**: Core functionality broken, significant performance degradation  
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature broken, cosmetic issues, non-critical errors
- **P3 (Low)**: Enhancement requests, documentation updates

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Assess impact and determine if rollback needed
2. **Communication**: Update status page, notify stakeholders
3. **Mitigation**: Execute rollback or hotfix as appropriate
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and prevention planning
5. **Follow-up**: Post-mortem, process improvements, documentation updates

## Testing Rollback Scenarios

### Test Cases
1. **Simple Rollback**: Roll back prod to previous version
2. **Cross-Environment**: Roll back stage, verify prod unaffected
3. **Specific Version**: Roll back to exact version (not just previous)
4. **Failed Rollback**: Handle rollback workflow failure
5. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple environments being accessed during rollback

### Validation Steps
- Verify rollback workflow completes successfully
- Confirm target environment shows correct version
- Test application functionality post-rollback
- Verify other environments remain unaffected
- Check that subsequent deployments work correctly

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Deployment success rate
- Time to rollback (MTTR)
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
- User-reported issues per deployment
- Performance regression frequency

### Alert Thresholds
- Build failures: Immediate notification
- Health check failures: Alert after 2 failures in 5 minutes
- Performance degradation: Alert if >30% slower than baseline
- Error rate: Alert if >5% of requests result in errors

## Documentation & Training

### Runbooks
- Step-by-step rollback procedures for each environment
- Common troubleshooting scenarios and solutions
- Emergency contact information and escalation procedures
- Post-incident review templates

### Regular Testing
- Monthly rollback drills in non-production environments
- Quarterly disaster recovery testing
- Annual review and update of risk management procedures
- Team training on new processes and tools
